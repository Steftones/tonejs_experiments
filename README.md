Overview
--------

This folder contains files exploring using the Tone.js and NexusUI Javascript libraries to implement the musical theories of the composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schillinger">Joseph Schillinger</a>.

index.html - Single page app with a "Play" button. Calculates a Schiilinger resultant (see my <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2007/08/09/making-perl-modules.html">article</a> on Perl.com for a better description of the concept) and plays a set of pitches based on the resultant.

You can see/hear the app at http://andysylvester.com/files/tonejs_experiments/
